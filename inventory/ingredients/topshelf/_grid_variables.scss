/*
You have two ways to do mobile-first development with neat.

You can read more about it in detail in /inventory/recipes/neat/README. I heavily suggest that, it makes a lot of sense.

Once you've read that, know that I've included Chasers which has omega-reset() built in. If you go that route, it will work fine.

Otherwise you can use the media-query splitting technique, which is what is default above. Feel free to replace them with your own queries.

Garnish includes some helpers to make queries easier. Read the README inside /inventory/recipes/garnish for full docs.

Choose whatever style works best for you / your team / your project / use both when it makes sense.
